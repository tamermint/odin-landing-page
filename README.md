# odin-landing-page

This project is a website built from scratch. The assignment in question is Odin-Project's landing page.

The project will seek to demonstrate my HTML and CSS skills and in turn help me solidify my understanding on core front-end development skills

This project does not use any javascript yet so most of the content may be unresponsive. This may not be the perfect replica of Odin's project assignment requirements but a best effort of sorts :)
